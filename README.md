# React Snake AI Viewer
This project was created to showcase an application I created at https://github.com/JoshuaTrevor/NEAT-Java . It contains an agent playing the game "Snake". This agent was trained in under two hours using an evolutionary machine learning library which I built from scratch using Java.

The site itself is viewable at https://snakeai-joshuatrevor.netlify.app/
